# Using the following starter code:
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
c = [7, 8, 9]
d = []
e = []

#Q1
list_1=[a,b,c]
print(list_1)

#Q2: what is the other way to achieve this? 
# for x in b:
#     a.append(x)
# for x in c:
#     a.append(x)
# print(a)

#Q2: simpler way to achieve the same result, comment out the previous solution first
print (a+b+c)
